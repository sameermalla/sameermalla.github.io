# GES772 Repository

This is my respository for the Spring 2016 GES772 class.
There are two files for the Homework 5 assignment:
* The Countries.js JavaScript file

Three countries in the Americas (North and South America) are selected and shown in red
* Mexico
* Brazil
* Argentia

Three countries in Europe are selected and shown in blue
* Spain

* Croatia

Popups, when clicked on any of these six countries, show the name and the population of the said country on the map
